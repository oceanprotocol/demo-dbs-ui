## üèÑ Get Started

The project uses NextJS + TypeScript + CSS modules and will connect to Ocean remote components by default.

This is an example Demo for [DBS UI Library](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dbs-ui-lib) which uses the Ocean Decentralized Backend storage.

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (required). Check the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file to make sure you are using the correct version of Node.js.
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended). This is the recommend way to manage Node.js versions.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required to follow the instructions below.

To start local development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/demo-dbs-ui.git
cd demo-dbs-ui

# when using nvm to manage Node.js versions
nvm use 20

npm install
# in case of dependency errors, rather use:
# npm install --legacy-peer-deps

npm run dev
# to build the project and run it in dev mode.
```

Run `npm run build` from the root folder to build the library. This creates `dist` folder which contains everything that
would be published to npm.

# if you encounter this error: Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
Run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before building.

## üöÄ Usage

Import and use the DBS UI components in your app:

```bash
import { DBSUploader } from '@oceanprotocol/dbs-ui-lib';

<DBSUploader 
   dbs_url={process.env.DBS_URL}
   dbs_account={process.env.DBS_ACCOUNT}
   infuraId={process.env.PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID}
   walletConnectProjectId={process.env.PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID}
/>
```

To enable the functionality of the DBSUploader, the following setting variables need to be set:

| Variable                | Description                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `dbs_url`               | URL for DBS service communication                    |
| `dbs_account`           | Account info for DBS authentication                  |
| `infuraId`              | Project ID for Ethereum access via Infura            |
| `walletConnectProjectId`| Project ID for WalletConnect integration             |

These variables are needed to interact with the DBS service, provide authentication credentials, access the Ethereum network through Infura, and enable integration with WalletConnect. 

## üõ≥ Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```
