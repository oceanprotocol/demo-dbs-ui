## üèÑ Get Started

The project uses NextJS + TypeScript + CSS modules and will connect to Ocean remote components by default.

This is an example Demo for [Uploader UI Library](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib) which uses the Ocean Decentralized Backend storage.

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (required). Check the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file to make sure you are using the correct version of Node.js.
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended). This is the recommend way to manage Node.js versions.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required to follow the instructions below.

To start local development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/uploader-ui.git
cd uploader-ui

# when using nvm to manage Node.js versions
nvm use 20

npm install

npm run dev
# to build the project and run it in dev mode.
```

Run `npm run build` from the root folder to build the project.

# if you encounter this error: Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
Run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before building.

## üöÄ Usage

Import and use the Uploader UI components in your app:

```bash
import '@oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib/dist/index.es.css';
const Uploader = dynamic(() => import('@oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib').then((module) => module.Uploader), { ssr: false });

<Uploader
   uploader_url={process.env.UPLOADER_URL || 'https://api.uploader.oceanprotocol.com/'}
   uploader_account={process.env.UPLOADER_ACCOUNT || '0x5F8396D1BfDa5259Ee89196F892E4401BF3B596d'}
   infuraId={process.env.INFURA_ID || ''}
   walletConnectProjectId={process.env.WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID || ''}
/> 
```

To enable the functionality of the Uploader, the following setting variables need to be set:

| Variable                | Description                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `uploader_url`               | URL for Uploader service communication                    |
| `uploader_account`           | Account info for Uploader authentication                  |
| `infuraId`              | Project ID for Ethereum access via Infura            |
| `walletConnectProjectId`| Project ID for WalletConnect integration             |

These variables are needed to interact with the Uploader, provide authentication credentials, access the Ethereum network through Infura, and enable integration with WalletConnect. 

## NextJS Setup for Ocean Protocol Uploader UI Library

To configure NextJS for the integration of Ocean's Uploader UI library, modify your `next.config.js` file to include these fallbacks:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.resolve.fallback = { 
      fs: false,
      process: false,
      net: false,
      tls: false
    };
    return config;
  },
};
```
** add these fallbacks to avoid any issue related to webpack 5 Polyfills imcompatibility: https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5#automatic-nodejs-polyfills-removed

install dependencies:

```javascript
> npm install @oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib
```

Import the library's CSS into your project:
```javascript
> import '@oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib/dist/index.es.css';
```

Dynamically import the Uploader component and ensure it is not processed during server-side rendering (SSR) using the next/dynamic function:

```javascript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
...

const Uploader = dynamic(() => import('@oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib').then((module) => module.Uploader), { ssr: false });
```

When incorporating the Uploader component into your application, make sure to set 'use client' on top in your app's component. This ensures that the component operates on the client side, bypassing SSR when rendering:

```javascript
'use client'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
```

This comprehensive setup ensures the proper integration and functioning of the Ocean Protocol's Uploader UI library within a NextJS application.

## üõ≥ Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```
