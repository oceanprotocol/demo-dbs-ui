## üèÑ Get Started

The project uses NextJS + TypeScript + CSS modules and will connect to Ocean remote components by default.

This is an example Demo for [Uploader UI Library](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib) which uses the Ocean Decentralized Backend storage.

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (required). Check the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file to make sure you are using the correct version of Node.js.
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended). This is the recommend way to manage Node.js versions.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required to follow the instructions below.

To start local development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/uploader-ui.git
cd uploader-ui

# when using nvm to manage Node.js versions
nvm use 20

npm install

npm run dev
# to build the project and run it in dev mode.
```

Run `npm run build` from the root folder to build the project.

# if you encounter this error: Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
Run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before building.

## üöÄ Usage

Import and use the Uploader UI components in your app:

```bash
import '@oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib/dist/index.es.css';
const Uploader = dynamic(() => import('@oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib').then((module) => module.Uploader), { ssr: false });

<Uploader
   uploader_url={process.env.UPLOADER_URL || 'https://api.uploader.oceanprotocol.com/'}
   uploader_account={process.env.UPLOADER_ACCOUNT || '0x5F8396D1BfDa5259Ee89196F892E4401BF3B596d'}
   infuraId={process.env.INFURA_ID || ''}
   walletConnectProjectId={process.env.WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID || ''}
/> 
```

To enable the functionality of the Uploader, the following setting variables need to be set:

| Variable                | Description                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `uploader_url`               | URL for Uploader service communication                    |
| `uploader_account`           | Account info for Uploader authentication                  |
| `infuraId`              | Project ID for Ethereum access via Infura            |
| `walletConnectProjectId`| Project ID for WalletConnect integration             |

These variables are needed to interact with the Uploader, provide authentication credentials, access the Ethereum network through Infura, and enable integration with WalletConnect. 

## üõ≥ Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```
